# CheaMD

CheaMD is a **personal project**, that aims to build molecular simulations, focusing on high performance rather than physically accurate interactions to increase process timescales. More like a "game" and less like a cientific tool.

## Objectives

- General molecule movement.
- Protein-molecule binding.
- Membrane transport simulations.
    - Active transport: Receptor-ligand binding.
- Non-covalent interactions.
    - NOT: Covalent bond making-breaking. For now.

## Lower your expectations

This is a personal project. So do NOT expect:

- The best programming practices.
- In-depth knowledge of physics/mathematics.
- Fast progress.

## TODO list - documented progress

- [ ] Everything!

- [ ] Plan for atom storage - optimal access in memory (data structures).
- [ ] Plan for grid structure to save time.
- [ ] Plan for interactions and force calculations.
- [ ] Plan for output saving and input processing - custom file input at first.
